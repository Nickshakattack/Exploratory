Project Proposal: Smart Home System Simulation
Description


  I’m building a Smart Home System that simulates managing devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras. The system will allow the user to control devices (turning them on/off, adjusting settings), and it will also trigger alerts for things like motion detection or temperature changes. The system will be interactive, either through a simple interface or command-line input.

  Key Features:

Device Management: 
Simulate lights, thermostats, and cameras.

User Interaction: 
Control devices through an interface.

Alerts: 
Trigger notifications based on security events.

Automation: 
Schedule devices to turn on/off or adjust automatically.

  Goals:

Object-Oriented Design: 
Learn how to organize the system using classes and objects.

Function Design: 
Practice creating functions with parameters and return values.

Abstraction:
Use classes to hide device details and make the system easier to expand.

Iterative Development: 
Track progress through GitHub commits.

Troubleshooting: 
Debug issues and refine the system.

System Breakdown
Classes:

Device (base class):
Shared functionality for devices (on/off, status).

Light: 
Simulates a light with adjustable brightness.

Thermostat: 
Simulates a thermostat with temperature control.

SecurityCamera: 
Simulates a camera with motion detection.

Controller: 
Manages device interactions and user input.

Functions:
Control Devices: Functions to turn devices on/off or adjust settings.

Automation: 
Functions to schedule actions (e.g., temperature changes).

Alerts: 
Functions to trigger alerts based on security events.

  Version Control:
I’ll use GitHub to track development and make regular commits with clear descriptions. The commits will show progress in implementing classes, functions, and bug fixes.
